# Chess-Game
A python chess game built using the Turtle library.
To start the game, simply clone the repo, and run:
```
python main.py
```
and the game will start.

The game ends when the black chess piece (player) has captured
all red chess pieces(Computer), or when either side is unable to
make a move anymore.
